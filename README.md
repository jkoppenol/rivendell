# Rivendell wiki
A wiki project to contain notes/instructions made bij Jeffrodo

This project will only contain wiki and wiki related resources.

# Ideas
## for shaping this wiki
- Primarily this project's wiki will be initialised via the GitHub UI
- Then Clone it locally and open/manage it via Gollum
- Update Home page (perhaps enable hidden Gollum features)
- Make this repo private, then push the wiki local repo back to GitLab (verify if this works)
- Check if wiki can still be accessed via UI

## for publishing this wiki
- Decide how to recognize wiki which can be made 'public' (e.g. use 'pub' branch?)
- Create a pipeline which copies/processes 'publishable' wiki to my website

# Resources
There are some resources on the www and in GitHub which provide guidance when working with GitHub wiki and Gollum:
